["strat-info.html", "Section 2 Strategy Information 2.1 Curve Carry 2.2 Trend Following 2.3 Remarks", " Section 2 Strategy Information In its current form, the Polar Star Quantitative Commodity Fund makes use of two flavours of quantitative strategies namely Curve Carry and Trend Following. In the following, we will take a closer look at each of the strategies. 2.1 Curve Carry The Curve Carry strategy tries to harness predictable and repeatable calendar spread dynamics in a universe of commodities given in the table below. N Commodity Long Name Sector 1 JO Orange Juice Dairy and Juice 2 CL WTI Crude Oil Energies 3 HO Heating Oil Energies 4 NG Natural Gas Energies 5 QS Gas Oil Energies 6 XB Gasoline Energies 7 BO Soybean Oil Grains and Oilseeds 8 C Corn Grains and Oilseeds 9 KO Palm Oil Grains and Oilseeds 10 KW Kansas Wheat Grains and Oilseeds 11 RR Rough Rice Grains and Oilseeds 12 RS Canola Grains and Oilseeds 13 S Soybeans Grains and Oilseeds 14 SM Soybean Meal Grains and Oilseeds 15 W Chicago Wheat Grains and Oilseeds 16 LB Lumber Industrial Materials 17 HG Copper Industrial Metals 18 LA Aluminium Industrial Metals 19 LN Nickel Industrial Metals 20 LX Zinc Industrial Metals 21 FC Feeder Cattle Meats and Livestock 22 LC Live Cattle Meats and Livestock 23 LH Lean Hogs Meats and Livestock 24 CC New York Cocoa Soft Commodities 25 CT Cotton Soft Commodities 26 DF Robusta Coffee Soft Commodities 27 KC Arabica Coffee Soft Commodities 28 QC London Cocoa Soft Commodities 29 QW Refined Sugar Soft Commodities 30 SB Raw Sugar Soft Commodities The Curve Carry strategy tries to harness predictable and repeatable calendar spread dynamics in a universe of commodities given in the table below. During each month and for all of the commodities shown we have identified calendar spreads that have repeatable behaviour year after year. In the majority of cases, we make a profit from the curve carry strategy by taking a bet that the shape of the commodity futures curve will become more contango or remain unchanged going into expiry of the near dated contract. This phenomenon of increasing contango is especially common in commodities that have a storage component associated in their const structures. Commodity futures curves are divided by obstacles to intertemporal arbitrage. The costlier the storage, the greater is the division and the variability of carry. The segmented commodity futures curve is shaped by four factors: Funding and storage costs, Expected supply and demand imbalanced, Convenience yields and Hedging pressure. Under normal conditions, commodity producers take short futures positions in the deferred parts of the commodity futures curve to hedge against price drops. The investor or speculator that offers this insurance is paid a premium and takes a long position in the futures contract. This positive premium comes in the form of the carry premium. On the other hand, commodity consumers take long futures positions in nearer dated contracts to hedge against unexpected future price surges. The investor or speculator that offers this insurance receives a premium for taking up the risk and takes a short position, in which case contango arises. In the plot below we show the cumulative returns from short near and far dated calendar spreads in the commodities shown. To be clear, short spread implies a short position in the near dated contract and a long position in the far dated contract. For every commodity and spread tenure, we use the ETF-trick to show the value of a $1 investment at the start of the time-series. If the value of the investment increases it implies the spread became more contango. If it decreases the spread became more backwardated. The plot below gives a bird’s eye view of these return streams. Some of the series are choppy such as those of DF and JO, while others are smooth and almost linear. Most of the curve carry returns are positive over the long run but there are a couple of exceptions, the most prominent one being QW. Similar to the way a trend following portfolio is constructed by scaling the different return series for volatility and taking the global correlation structure into account we perform a bootstrapping procedure to determine baseline weights for the different commodity calendar spread pairs from month to month. The last piece of the system is the risk management of the strategy which is performed using meta-labeling. Meta-labeling is a machine learning technique used to determine the probability that a particular trade will be in the money. It consists of a binary classification algorithm for each commodity-calendar-spread pair that takes a collection of time-series features as input parameters. For our purposes, we make use of Scikit Learn’s Random Forest classifier algorithm. For a detailed discussion on how to label time series data for use in machine learning applications, the work of Marcos Lopez de Prado is invaluable. Finally, we make use of the probability of the trade to be in the money to scale the positions within the portfolio. If a calendar looses 50 bps we close half the positions, another 25 bps and we close out the remaining spreads. Below we show the step-by-step process involved in the strategy: At the beginning of the month determine the full fund NAV. Calculate the Curve Carry split of the NAV. Look up the commodities and calendar spreads to be allocated to during the current month, this also determines the side of the bet. Calculate roll adjusted time-series. Use the returns from roll adjusted time-series to determine ETF prices of the near and far dated calendar spreads for each commodity. Make use of bootstrapping process to determine baseline instrument weights. Calculate a collection of time-series features for use in meta-labeling. Fractionally differentiate input features to ensure stationarity. Train meta-label models - quarterly. Apply meta-label models to each of the commodity-calendar-spread pairs to determine the probability of profit. Scale baseline weights according to meta-labeling output. Create orderbook of target number of contracts. Roll half of the portfolio forward on business day 2 - We make use of EMSX to route trades through Bloomberg to our traders at SocGen. Finish the roll forward on business day 3. As the NAV of the fund grows we will split the allocation to the Curve Carry Strategy in buckets and treat eat bucket as a separate strategy with a different roll timing methodology. On the first split, we will add a roll on business days 10 and 11. The main reason for this is to avoid rebalance timing luck as much as possible. With limited AUM this is not currently feasible. 2.2 Trend Following Our trend following philosophy is greatly inspired by the works of Kathryn Kaminski and Robert Carver with the exception that we focus only on commodity markets. Here we make use of our fundamental team’s expertise in determining the roll schedules and contracts that we are involved in for each of the commodities. For many of the commodities, we are looking at two different parts of the curve to add a layer of diversification. Our trend following commodity universe is listed in the table below. N Commodity Long Name Sector 1 CHE Cheese Dairy and Juice 2 DA Milk Dairy and Juice 3 JO Orange Juice Dairy and Juice 4 CL WTI Crude Oil Energies 5 CO Brent Crude Oil Energies 6 HO Heating Oil Energies 7 NG Natural Gas Energies 8 QS Gas Oil Energies 9 XB Gasoline Energies 10 BO Soybean Oil Grains and Oilseeds 11 C Corn Grains and Oilseeds 12 KO Palm Oil Grains and Oilseeds 13 KW Kansas Wheat Grains and Oilseeds 14 MW Minneapolis Wheat Grains and Oilseeds 15 RR Rough Rice Grains and Oilseeds 16 RS Canola Grains and Oilseeds 17 S Soybeans Grains and Oilseeds 18 SM Soybean Meal Grains and Oilseeds 19 W Chicago Wheat Grains and Oilseeds 20 LB Lumber Industrial Materials 21 OR Rubber Industrial Materials 22 HG Copper Industrial Metals 23 LA Aluminium Industrial Metals 24 LN Nickel Industrial Metals 25 LX Zinc Industrial Metals 26 FC Feeder Cattle Meats and Livestock 27 LC Live Cattle Meats and Livestock 28 LH Lean Hogs Meats and Livestock 29 GC Gold Precious Metals 30 PA Palladium Precious Metals 31 PL Platinum Precious Metals 32 SI Silver Precious Metals 33 CC New York Cocoa Soft Commodities 34 CT Cotton Soft Commodities 35 DF Robusta Coffee Soft Commodities 36 KC Arabica Coffee Soft Commodities 37 QC London Cocoa Soft Commodities 38 QW Refined Sugar Soft Commodities 39 SB Raw Sugar Soft Commodities We took a page from Robert Carver’s work in designing and not fitting a trend following strategy. To this end, we constructed fake trendy data of different lengths, shapes and added volatilities. We are specifically interested in medium to long term trends ranging from one to eighteen months in length. Examples of fake trendy data are shown in the image below. Like most trend following systems, we scale positions according to individual instrument volatility and correlations with the other instruments. We make use of a collection of different trend signals in determining the overall signal for each instrument. Position sizes are scaled continuously depending on the signal strength and we do not make use of stop-losses. The strategy targets annual volatility of 20%. Carver inspired us to follow the scaled forecast methodology where an average positive trend is awarded a value of +10, while an average negative trend is given the value of -10. We cap the size of the scaled forecasts at +20 and -20. Long signals are initiated with scaled aggregated forecasts that are greater than 0. Similarly, short positions are initiated with signals of less than 0. Below we show the step-by-step process involved in the strategy: At the beginning of the month determine the full fund NAV. Calculate the Trend Following split of the NAV. Determine when to roll contracts forward, if at all. steps 1 to 3 are determined at the beginning of each month, the remainder of the steps are performed on a daily basis. Calculate roll adjusted time-series. Calculate trend forecasts signals on roll adjusted time-series 5.1 Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages 5.2 Donchain Breakouts 5.3 Lookback windows ranging from one to eighteen months Calculate aggregate forecast taking into account signal correlations and volatility. Determine target position sizes using the aggregate forecast, instrument volatility and correlation structure. Orderbook generated from the difference between current and target number of contracts for each commodity and contract code. To avoid overtrading we apply a 10% threshold to the change in position. Trades routed using EMSX to traders at SocGen. The trend system gets awarded and allocation of between 35 and 25% of the capital. This is a discretionary split that relies on the portfolio manager’s comfort level as well as some baseline weights calculated using the Black-Litterman approach to portfolio optimisation. 2.3 Remarks We are constantly exploring possible additional strategies to add to the main quantitative fund. These new strategies are tested with real money inside the much larger Polar Star Limited Flagship relative value commodity fund. The addition of these strategies into the quantitative fund is subject to available AUM. "],
["trade-examples.html", "Section 3 Trade Examples 3.1 Curve Carry Examples 3.2 Trend Following Examples 3.3 Remarks and References", " Section 3 Trade Examples In this section we show some examples where each of the strategies had winning and losing trades. 3.1 Curve Carry Examples The plot below shows the returns associated with each of the commodities inside the Curve Carry strategy. The results are presented on the same y-axis to make comparisons easier. From the image below it is clear that lean hogs (LH), natural gas (NG), refined sugar (QW), WTI crude (CL), RBOB gasoline (XB) and live cattle (LC) have had the greatest positive contributions to the performance of the strategy since inception. Negative performance on the other hand is dominated by Malaysian palm oil (KO) and cotton (CT). 3.1.1 Winning Trade - LH Lean hogs has been a solid return producer for the curve carry strategy since inception. The plot below highlights the cumulative performance contribution to the fund’s performance since its inception. The plot below highlights the value of $1 invested in the near and far dated lean hog calendar spreads. Note that the results are shown on a logarithmic scale. The solid vertical line is set at 1 Jan 2019, the start of the quantitative commodity fund. Notice that both the near and far dated calendar spread performed tremendously well since the inception of the fund, but the results can also be extended back to the early 2000s There is an interesting fundamental reason for this curve behaviour in the lean hog market. The shorthand version is that the United States struggles to keep pace with the projected number of hogs that they want to slaughter. A hog farmer cannot feed her hogs beyond a certain weight because the economics of it does not make sense. When the hogs hit their respective slaughter weights they have to compete with other farmers’ hogs for space at pork processing and packing facilities. Here the processors and packers can choose the cheapest hogs and drive to front of the futures curve down creating the formation of contango heading into expiry. For more information please see this link. 3.1.2 Losing Trade - KO Malaysian palm oil has been a choppy performer for the curve carry strategy since inception. The plot below highlights the cumulative performance contribution to the fund’s performance since its inception. The plot below highlights the value of $1 invested in the near and far dated Malaysian palm oil calendar spreads. This is a commodity where we take both long and short calendar spread exposure, but it has proven difficult to trade successfully thus far. 3.2 Trend Following Examples The plot below shows the returns associated with each of the commodities inside the Trend Following Strategy. The performance of palladium (PA) is a good positive return to note. Strong negative performance can be seen in milk (DA) and rubber (OR). 3.2.1 Trend Following Commentary Recently there has been a collection of research trying to understand the underperformance of trend following strategies over the last decade. Some of the more interesting results are shown below: You Can’t Always Trend When You Want - AQR The researchers at AQR produced an interesting piece where they studied trend following performance as a function of the absolute size of market moves. The plot above shows the main result. The last couple of years have been highlighted in yellow. Note that there have not been nearly as strong market moves compared to historical results. Breaking Bad Trends - Garg, Goulding, Harvey and Mazzoleni The above paper is quite interesting and looks at the trend following performance from a turning point of view. Intuitively, the more turning points we have in price series the lower the trend following return should be. This is mainly because of being whipsawed in and out of trades couples with trading costs and slippage. The plot below shows trend following performance as a function of the number of turning points. Notice the steady negative slope of the medians within the boxplots. The plot below shows the same results but represented in a slightly different way. Here we can see that the last couple of years have had many more turning points in the price series compared to historical data. The question is then if we will continue to see an environment consisting of weak trends coupled with many turning points? We are not sure and do not claim to know the answer. However, if we see behaviour more closely aligned to the type of trends we have seen in the past we can be sure that trend following systems will perform well. In the meantime, we are happy to wait it out. 3.2.2 Winning Trade - PA During 2019 the palladium trade was one where many trend following strategies would have been involved. In the facet plot below we show the cumulative return from the trade, the forecast values as well as the roll adjusted price. We had long positions where the forecasted numbers were roughly greater than 5. As the signal strength increased we added to the position. We exited from the long palladium trade during Feb/Mar 2020. 3.2.3 Losing Trade - DA We only added milk to the trend following portfolio during Jan 2020. The main reason for the late addition was that it is not a commodity the team has traded in the past from a fundamental or relative value perspective. Our test showed that the addition of milk will add some diversification benefits to the portfolio. The results below show the cumulative return, aggregate scaled forecast and roll adjusted price of milk since its inception of the fund. Note that we also include those times where milk was not included in the portfolio. Milk was in a sustained uptrend from May 2019 through Dec 2019 before it started on a downward path before recouping in May. These price swings were too fast for our model to successfully capitalise on. We remain positive that the milk market will add additional diversification benefits to our trend following model. There are some interesting dynamics taking place in the dairy markets because of supply chain disruptions caused by the global coronavirus crisis. Here is a link to an interesting video by Vox explaining the problem in some detail. 3.3 Remarks and References Below we list a couple reference highlighting the benefits of adding trend and carry type strategies in a combined portfolio.
